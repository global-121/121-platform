# Workflows / Playbook / Manual

In this file we document "how to do X", manually. As not everything is possible (yet) via the interfaces.

## What to do in case of 'waiting' or 'failed' payments

- See [Activity Diagram for 'Send payment instructions'](https://github.com/global-121/121-platform/wiki/Send-payment-instructions) for more insight into possible scenarios.
- If transaction is on "failed"
  - If `whatsappPhoneNumber` is invalid (most observed scenario so far)
    - **Pilot-team** updates `whatsappPhoneNumber` in HO-portal
    - **Pilot-team** retries payment for each payment number from payment-status-popup in HO-portal
    - Note that the voucher is visible in the portal anyway, so could also be transferred manually (but not preferred)
  - If failed for other reason
    - **Pilot-team** informs **121-dev-team**
    - **121-dev-team** does ad-hoc investigation
- If transaction is on "waiting"
  - Note that the voucher is visible in the portal anyway, so can already be transferred manually
  - In addition, it is still wise to find out why it's on 'waiting'. Wait for 24 hours, then contact PA to find out what's going on.

## Change SMS and/or WhatsApp phone-numbers for Person Affected

> ⚠️ This is now possible directly from HO-portal.

1. PA gets in contact with **Pilot-team** if phone is lost
2. **Pilot-team** provides to **121-dev-team**:
   - Name: can be any of the first/second/third/last name attributes
   - Old phone number(s): can be SMS and/or WhatsApp phone number
   - New WhatsApp phone(s)-number (if need to replace)
   - New SMS phone-number (if need to replace)
3. **121-dev-team**:
   1. Find the `registration` of the PA that we want to update, using `Find Reference ID of PA in database based on name and/or phone number` scenario below.
   2. Use the found registration `referenceId` to update the phone-numbers.
      - Use: [`/registrations/attribute`](https://test-vm.121.global/121-service/docs/#/registrations/post_registrations_attribute)
        - To store the new WhatsApp phone-number, with: `key` set to `whatsappPhoneNumber`)
        - To store the new SMS phone-number use the same endpoint with: `key` set to `phoneNumer` (For bot a phone number check is included, with automatic sanitization as far as possible.)

## Change Financial Service Provider for Person Affected

> ⚠️ This is now possible directly from HO-portal.

1. PA gets in contact with **Pilot-team** if Financial Service Provider needs to be updated
2. **Pilot-team** provides to **121-dev-team**:
   - Name: can be any of the first/second/third/last name attributes
   - and/or Phone number(s): can be SMS and/or WhatsApp phone number
   - New FSP: (`Intersolve-whatsapp` or `Intersolve-no-whatsapp`)
   - New WhatsApp phone number (if switching to `Intersolve-whatsapp`)
3. **121-dev-team**:
   1. Find the `registration` of the PA that we want to update, using `Find Reference ID of PA in database based on name and/or phone number` scenario below.
   2. Update FSP: Use the found registration `referenceId` to update the Financial Service Provider.
      - Use: [`/registrations/update-chosen-fsp`](https://test-vm.121.global/121-service/docs/#/registrations/post_registrations_update_chosen_fsp)
      - Fill in the found `referenceId`
      - Choose the right new FSP name. It must be one out of the provided list.
      - Fill in the required attributes. If the new FSP requires more attributes than the example-provided `whatsappPhoneNumber`, you can manually change this.
      - When you use the endpoint, it will tell you anyway if you are missing attributes and if so, which.

## Find Reference ID of PA in database based on name and/or phone number

1. [Log-in via Swagger-UI](./README.md#api-sign-uplog-in) as a user with the "`registration:reference-id.search`"-permission
2. Find the `registration` of the PA that we want to update.
   Use the endpoint: [`/registrations/search-name-phone`](https://test-vm.121.global/121-service/docs/#/registrations/post_registrations_search_name_phone)
   Where you can optionally fill in `name` and/or old `phoneNumber` to search for.

   This will return all registrations that match _at least one_ of the parameters.

   - If 0 registrations are returned, try spelling variations.
   - If multiple registrations are returned, try to figure out which is the correct one.
     - Maybe there are PA with the same name, but different phone-numbers?
     - Maybe one is an unfinished registration?
     - Check back with the **Pilot-team** if still unclear.
   - If 1 registration is returned, continue

## Get monitoring data

1. [Log-in via Swagger-UI](./README.md#api-sign-uplog-in) as a user with the "`program:metrics.read`"-permission
2. Use the endpoint: [`/programs/monitoring/{programId}`](https://test-vm.121.global/121-service/docs/#/programs/get_programs_monitoring__programId_)
   Fill in the `programId` = 1.

   This will return all registrations, with attributes:

   - Monitoring-question answer
   - Registration duration (in seconds)
   - PA status

## Get list of vouchers marked as 'to cancel' (Intersolve)

Since 2022-01-04 (code-date not deploy-date) we are not canceling vouchers any more, but do keep marking them as 'to cancel'.
This workflow explains how to get out a list of 'to cancel' vouchers.

1. [Log-in via Swagger-UI](./README.md#api-sign-uplog-in) as a user with the "`registration:personal.export`"-permission
2. Use the endpoint: [`/export-metrics/export-list`](https://test-vm.121.global/121-service/docs/#/export-metrics/post_export_metrics_export_list)
   Fill in `type` = "to-cancel-vouchers" and `programId` = 1. Delete the other (optional) properties.

   This will return an object which includes the relevant 'data' property in json-format

3. Use any online json-to-csv converter if needed.
4. Filter on date before/after 2022-01-04 to distinguish between actual canceled vouchers or 'marked as canceled' vouchers
