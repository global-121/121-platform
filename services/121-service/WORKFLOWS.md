# Workflows / Playbook / Manual

In this file we document "how to do X", manually. As not everything is possible (yet) via the interfaces.

## Find Reference ID of PA in database based on name and/or phone number and/or PA id

1. [Log-in via Swagger-UI](./README.md#api-sign-uplog-in) as a user with the "`registration:reference-id.search`"-permission
2. Find the `registration` of the PA that we want to update.
   Use the endpoint: [`/registrations/search-phone`](https://test-vm.121.global/121-service/docs/#/registrations/post_registrations_search_phone)
   Where you can optionally fill in `name` and/or old `phoneNumber` and/or `id` (PA-id in portal) to search for.

   This will return all registrations that match _at least one_ of the parameters.

   - If 0 registrations are returned, try spelling variations.
   - If multiple registrations are returned, try to figure out which is the correct one.
     - Maybe there are PA with the same name, but different phone-numbers?
     - Maybe one is an unfinished registration?
     - Check back with the **Pilot-team** if still unclear.
   - If 1 registration is returned, continue

## Delete PA

In the 121-portal only PAs with certain status can be deleted, while the API endpoint gives more flexibility.

1. [Log-in via Swagger-UI](./README.md#api-sign-uplog-in)
2. Look up the right `referenceId`s using the workflow above
3. Use the endpoint: [`/registrations/delete`](https://test-vm.121.global/121-service/docs/#/registrations/post_registrations_delete)
4. Fill in one or multiple `referenceId`s

## Get monitoring data

1. [Log-in via Swagger-UI](./README.md#api-sign-uplog-in) as a user with the "`program:metrics.read`"-permission
2. Use the endpoint: [`/programs/monitoring/{programId}`](https://test-vm.121.global/121-service/docs/#/programs/get_programs_monitoring__programId_)
   Fill in the `programId` = 1.

   This will return all registrations, with attributes:

   - Monitoring-question answer
   - Registration duration (in seconds)
   - PA status

## Get list of vouchers marked as 'to cancel' (Intersolve)

Since 2022-01-04 (code-date not deploy-date) we are not canceling vouchers any more, but do keep marking them as 'to cancel'.
This workflow explains how to get out a list of 'to cancel' vouchers.

1. [Log-in via Swagger-UI](./README.md#api-sign-uplog-in) as a user with the "`registration:personal.export`"-permission
2. Use the endpoint: [`/export-metrics/export-list`](https://test-vm.121.global/121-service/docs/#/export-metrics/post_export_metrics_export_list)
   Fill in `type` = "to-cancel-vouchers" and `programId` = 1. Delete the other (optional) properties.

   This will return an object which includes the relevant 'data' property in json-format

3. Use any online json-to-csv converter if needed.
4. Filter on date before/after 2022-01-04 to distinguish between actual canceled vouchers or 'marked as canceled' vouchers
