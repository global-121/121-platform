  - ProgramFinancialServiceProviderConfigurations
  - IntersolveVisa
  - MessageTemplate
  - MessageQueues (renamed from QueueMessage)
  - Transactions
  - Registration
  - Event
  - Redis
  
  For the segregation of duties implementation, it will also depend on the other (maintained only) FSP modules.
  In case other 121 Service Modules need to be added, please take a step back and reconsider the diagrams/architecture and have a conversation.

  Also see the stuff injected into the TransferJobProcessorsService.
