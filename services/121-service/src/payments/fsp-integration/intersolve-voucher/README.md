# Intersolve Voucher

This readme includes additional information / instructions on use of this FSP, that cannot be deduced from code.

NOTE: Currently the FSP Intersolve, which produces vouchers, is very much intertwined with WhatsApp as a delivery mechanism for delivering these vouchers. In that sense Intersolve is currently a lot more complex than other FSPs.
