With this message you will receive:
1. An Albert Heijn supermarket voucher (cadeaukaart) - this is the picture with the barcode.
2. An explanation on how to use the voucher in Albert Heijn.

If you received more than one voucher this is because you had not yet received vouchers from previous weeks.

 The amount that you receive is written on the top of the voucher.
You can spend the vouchers at any Albert Heijn supermarket in the Netherlands.

You don’t have to spend everything at once. So keep the vouchers and re-use them until the complete amount is finished.

You will receive your Albert Heijn voucher every week on Tuesday. When we end the support you will receive a message from us, explaining you when and why we end the support.

Do you have questions? Send us a message on WhatsApp: https://wa.me/3197010286964",
