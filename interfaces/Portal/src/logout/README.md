# Manual Override Log-Out

This folder contains the code for a "manual override" log-out or escape-hatch.
This allows a user to log out of the platform manually, without a functioning Portal-application (due to a bug, out-of-date cache or some other browser-issue).

The user would only have to visit the `/logout`-URL in their browser.
