Feature: Import people affected

  Background:
    Given a logged-in user with either the "run program" or the "personal data" role
    Given the "selected phase" is "Registration (& Validation)"

  Scenario: Download template for import
    Given the user clicks the "Import People Affected" button
    When the user clicks the "Download template CSV-file" button
    Then a CSV-file is downloaded
    And it contains only 1 row of column names
    And it contains the columns "phoneNumber", "segment" and "paymentAmountMultiplier"

  Scenario: Successfully Import People Affected
    Given a valid import CSV file is prepared
    And it has columns "phoneNumber", "segment" and "paymentAmountMultiplier"
    And it has as delimiter ";" or ","
    And the "paymentAmountMultiplier" column has only positive integers as values
    Given the user clicks the "Import People Affected" button
    When the user selects the CSV-file, through 'choose file' or 'drag and drop'
    Then the "OK" button becomes enabled
    
    When the user clicks "OK" to confirm the import
    Then a loading spinner appears
    
    When it is finished
    Then a feedback popup appears
    And it shows the number of successfully imported "phoneNumbers"
    And it shows the number of "phoneNumbers" that were already present in the system
    And it shows the number of invalid "phoneNumbers"
    And it shows an "OK" button
    And it mentions that a CSV is automatically downloaded with the import-result per row.
    And a download window for this CSV is appearing
    
    When the users clicks "OK" on the popup
    Then The popup disappears
    And the page refreshes
    And the PA-table now shows new rows equal to the number of successfully imported "phoneNumbers"
    And they have status "Imported"
    And the Imported date is filled in
    And the name of the "partner organization" is filled in

  Scenario: Unsuccessfully import invalid CSV file
    Given the user clicks the "Import People Affected" button
    When the user selects an invalid CSV-file (wrong extension, wrong column names, wrong delimiter, wrong input values, etc.)
    Then the "OK" button becomes enabled
    When the user clicks "OK" to confirm the import
    Then a feedback popup appears that "Something went wrong with the export" and it explains possible reasons

  Scenario: Person Affected registers with imported phone number
    Given a "phoneNumber" is successfully imported
    And there has been no registration with this "phoneNumber" yet (from after the import)
    When a new Person Affected starts registrations with this "phoneNumber" (see PA-app/New_registration.feature)
    Then a new row with status "Created" is shown in the PA-table in HO-portal
    and the row with status "Imported" is also still shown, because without the phone-number the system cannot know yet they belong together
    When the Person Affected finishes registrations with using the known "phoneNumber"
    Then the two rows are merged into one row with status "Registered"
    And the "partner organization" is visible
    And the "imported date" is visible
    And the "created digital ID" date is visible
    And the "completed vulnerability assessment" date is visible
    And the "inclusion score" is visible

  Scenario: Person Affected registers with unknown phone number
      """
      Normal registration (see PA-app/New_registration.feature)
      """

  Scenario: Person Affected registers with phone number that was imported initially, but already has a connected registration
      """
      Normal registration (see PA-app/New_registration.feature)
      """

  Scenario: Person Affected registers with phone number that was not imported, but is already in the system
      """
      Normal registration (see PA-app/New_registration.feature)
      """

Feature: Import registrations


  Background:
    Given a logged-in user with either the "run program" or the "personal data" role
    Given the "selected phase" is "Registration (& Validation)"
    Given the user clicks the "Import registrations" button

  Scenario: Download template for import registrations
    When the user clicks the "Download template CSV-file" button
    Then a CSV-file is downloaded
    And it contains only 1 row of column names
    And it contains the generic column names "segment", "preferredLanguage", "phoneNumber", "fspName"
    And it has program-dependent columns (for NL-LVV: "whatsappPhoneNumber", "nameFirst", "nameLast", "vnumber")

  Scenario: Successfully import registrations via CSV
    Given a valid import CSV file is prepared based on the template
    And it has generic columns "segment", "preferredLanguage", "phoneNumber", "fspName"
    And it has program-dependent columns (for NL-LVV: "whatsappPhoneNumber", "nameFirst", "nameLast", "vnumber")
    And it has as delimiter ";" or ","
    And it has "X" rows
    And the input of each cell is valid
    When the user clicks "OK" to confirm the import
    Then it shows the number "X" of successfully imported "phoneNumbers"
    And the PA-table in the HO-portal shows "X" new rows of PAs
    And they have status "Registered"
    And all other columns are filled as if a real registration was done
    And no SMS is sent to the PA unlike a real registration
    And in the AW-app the validation data for these PAs can be downloaded

  Scenario: Unsuccessfully import registrations via CSV
    Given an invalid import CSV file (wrong column names, disallowed values, etc.)
    When the user selects this file and clicks "OK" to confirm the import
    Then feedback is given that something went wrong and it gives details on where the error is, mainly if in a generic column
    And there is no input validation on the dynamic columns
