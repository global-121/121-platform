Feature: Make a new payment

  Background:
    Given a logged-in user with the "PaymentCREATE" permission
    And the user views the "payment" page

  Scenario: Show maximum total amount
    Given a new payment is possible on the program
    Given the number of "PA included" is more then "0"
    Given the generic "select bulk action" scenario (see View_and_Manage_people_affected.feature)
    When the user selects the "Do payment" action
    Then a "row checkbox" appears in the "select" column for eligible rows
    When the user selects 1 or more PA's
    Then the "apply action" button is enabled
    When clicking the "apply action" button
    Then the pop-up "Do payment" is shown
    And the "Transfer Value" is filled in with the program's default value
    And the pop-up shows the number of PAs to pay out to
    And it shows the maximum total amount to pay out
    And this total amount reflects that some PAs may receive more than the supplied "Transfer Value" because of a "paymentAmountMultiplier" greater than 1
    And this total amount is a maximum because some transactions might fail

  Scenario: Send payment instructions with changed transfer value
    Given the "Do payment" prompt is open
    Given the user changes the Transfer value to "20"
    When the user clicks the button "start payout now"
    Then the total maximum amount reflects the changed amount per PA
    When the user clicks the button "OK"
    Then the payment instructions list is sent to the Financial Service Provider
    And the payment instructions for each PA contain the transfer value "20" times the PA's "paymentAmountMultiplier"
    And a popup shows for how many PAs the instructions were successfully sent

  Scenario: Send payment instructions
    Given this is not the last payment for the program
    When the user confirms the payout
    Then the payment instructions list is sent to the Financial Service Provider
    And the payment instructions for each PA contain the transfer value times the PA's "paymentAmountMultiplier"
    And the message "Payout request successfully sent to X PAs" is shown
    And it shows an "OK" button
    When the users presses "OK"
    Then the page refreshes
    And the "export payment data" component now shows that the payment is "closed"
    And the "export payment data" component now has the next payment enabled
    And the "bulk action" dropdown list now shows the next available payment to do
    When clicking "Payment history"
    Then the payment history popup opens
    And it shows the payment number, the payment state, the payment date+time and the transaction amount
    And the payment state shows 'Success' when the payment went through
    And it shows 'Failed' for failed transactions
    And it shows 'Waiting' for waiting transactions
    And - for successful transactions - the PA receives (notification about) voucher/cash depending on the FSP
    And the 'Export people affected' in the 'Registration' phase now contains 3 new columns for the new payment: status, amount, timestamp

  Scenario: Send payment instructions for 10000 PAs
    Given there are 10000 PAs in the system
    And they are included (see e.g. Portal/Include_people_affected_Run_Program_role.feature)
    Then the user selects the "Do payment" action
    And the user selects all 10000 PAs
    And the user clicks the "Apply action" button and the "Do payment" popup shows up
    When the user clicks the "start payout now" button
    Then the message "Payout request successfully sent to X PAs" is shown
    And it mentions that it can take some time (very rough estimation: 0.5 seconds per PA)
    And it shows an "OK" button
    When the users presses "OK"
    Then the page refreshes
    And the "payout" button  is now disabled
    And it mentions that a payout is in progress
    And it shows a refresh icon
    When the user clicks the refresh icon
    Then the "Payment History" column will start showing more and more PA's with status waiting
    When the user clicks the refresh icon again
    Then the "Payment History" column will upgrade more and more PA's from 'waiting' to 'success' or 'error'
    When the user clicks the refresh icon again (given the payment has finished)
    Then the payout-in-progress message is gone
    And the "payout" button for the next payment is enabled again
    And the "Payment History" column may still contain PA's on 'waiting', as the status-callbacks go on longer then the request-loop
    When the user refreshes the page again
    Then eventually all 'waiting' PAs have upgraded to 'success' or 'error' (unless some status callback fails for some reason)

  Scenario: Retry failed payment for 1 PA
    Given the payment has failed for a PA
    When the user clicks the "Payment #x failed" button for this PA
    Then the "Payment History" popup appears
    And it shows all payments for this PA
    And the failed payment button shows the date and is red
    When the user clicks the button a new popup shows
    And it contains the error message and a retry-button
    Then the user clicks the retry-button
    And a normal payment scenario is started for this 1 PA only (see other scenario)

  Scenario: Retry payment for all failed payments of PAs
    Given the payment has failed for more than 1 PA
    Then the user sees the "Retry all failed" button above the bulk action dropdown
    When the user clicks it
    Then a popup appears
    And it shows the number of PAs for which the payment will be retried
    When the user clicks 'OK'
    And a normal payment scenario is started for this all the PAs  (see other scenario)
