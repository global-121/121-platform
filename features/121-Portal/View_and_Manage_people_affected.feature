    And depending on the "selected phase" only current people affected with given "PA statuses" are shown
    - "registration": imported, invited, created, selected for validation, no longer eligible, registered while no longer eligible
    - "inclusion": validated, registered, selected for validation, rejected, inclusion ended
    - "payment": included
    And for each person the "Select" column is empty
    And for each person a "PA identifier" is shown
    And it has a clickable "i" button in front of it, which opens a popup
    And depending on which "page" other columns are shown (see detailed scenarios below)
    And above the table a list of "bulk actions" is shown
    And next to it an "apply action" button is shown and it is "disabled"
    And above the table a free text "filter field" and a dropdown for "status filter" are shown

  Scenario: View columns of table WITHOUT access to personal data
    When the user views the PA-table
    Then the users sees the columns mentioned in the previous scenario
    And for each person a "status" is shown
    And all above columns are fixed when scrolling horizontally

  >> See View_payment_history_popup.feature

  Scenario: View columns of table WITH access to personal data
    Given the logged-in user also has "RegistrationPersonalREAD" permission
    When the user views the PA-table
    Then the user sees all columns available in previous scenario
    And the "i" button in front of the "PA identifier" contains a "note icon" if a note is saved for that PA
    And for each person a "name" is shown
    And for each person a "phone number" is shown
    And all above columns are fixed when scrolling horizontally
    And "custom attribute" columns are shown
    And some other hard-coded columns such as "vnumber" and "whatsappPhoneNumber" are shown if available

  Scenario: Edit boolean custom attributes in PA table
    Given the logged-in user also has "RegistrationAttributeUPDATE" permission
    Given the logged-in user is viewing the PA-table
    When the user clicks one of the "custom attribute" columns with type 'boolean'
    Then the clicked "custom attribute" is updated
    And the updated value is reflected in the PA-table

  Scenario: Filter rows of PA-table by string
    Given the table with all "people affected" relevant to the selected program phase is shown
    When the user enters any free text "abc" in the "filter field"
    Then the table immediately updates to show only rows where at least one case of "abc" is found as substring in any of the columns
    When the user removes the text again or presses the "X" close option
    Then the table shows all rows again

  Scenario: Filter rows of PA-table by People Affected status
    Given the table with all "people affected" relevant to the selected program phase is shown
    When the user clicks on the "status" button above the table
    Then a dropdown with all the possible statuses appears
    And only the statuses relevant to the current phase are selected
    When the user makes a different selection of statuses
    And the user clicks on "apply"
    Then the table immediately updates to show only rows that match the status selection
    When the user clicks on "cancel"
    Then the table keeps the row that matched the previous status selection

  Scenario: Show People Affected of all phases
    Given the table with all "people affected" relevant to the selected program phase is shown
    And the user has opened the "status" dropdown filter
    And an option to select "all" is on top of the list
    And the option is not checked
    When the user selects "all"
    Then all the statuses are selected
    When the user clicks on "apply"
    Then the table will now show all "people affected", also those from other phases
    And - if done while the filter text field contains text - then the filtered text keeps being applied
    When the user deselect "all"
    Then the table will not show any "people affected"

  Scenario: View available actions
    When the user opens up the "choose action" dropdown
    Then a list appears with available "bulk actions"
    And this is dependent on the currently logged-in "user" and "active phase" of the program

  Scenario: Select "bulk action" while rows eligible
    Given at least 1 person is eligible for the "bulk action"
    When the user selects a "bulk action"
    Then the dropdown now shows the name of the "bulk action" instead of "choose action"
    And the "apply action" button is "enabled"
    And a "row checkbox" appears in the "select" column for eligible rows
    And a "header checkbox" appears in the "select" column

  Scenario: Select "bulk action" while no rows eligible
    Given no people are eligible for the "bulk action"

    And the footer shows an updated number of selected people

  Scenario: Select all rows given no row selection
    Given a "bulk action" is selected
    And the "header checkbox" has appeared
    And the "header checkbox" is unchecked
    When the "user" checks the "header checkbox"
    Then all "row checkboxes" are selected and the "header checkbox" is selected
    When the "user" un-checks the "header checkbox"
    Then all "row checkboxes" are selected and the "header checkbox" is selected

  Scenario: Deselect all rows given full selection
    Given current "full" selection
    When unchecking "header checkbox"
    Then all "row checkboxes" are unchecked

  Scenario: Select all rows given partial selection
    Given current "partial" selection
    When user checks "header checkbox"
    Then all "row checkboxes" are checked

  Scenario: Unselect row given full selection
    Given current "full" selection
    When user un-checks single "row checkbox"
    Then the "header checkbox" also un-checks

  Scenario: Select row given (N-1) selection
    Given currently all eligible rows except 1 are selected
    When user checks last eligible row through "row checkbox"
    Then "header checkbox" also automatically checks

  Scenario: Apply action without SMS-option
    Given a "bulk action" is selected
    And 0 or more rows are selected
    And there is no custom-SMS option for this action
    When "user" clicks "apply action"
    Then a popup appears which lists which "bulk action" will be applied to "how many" people affected
    And it has a "confirm" button and a "cancel" button

  Scenario: Apply action with SMS-option
    Given a "bulk action" is selected
    And 0 or more rows are selected
    And there is a custom-SMS option for this action
    When "user" clicks "apply action"
    Then a popup appears which lists which "bulk action" will be applied to "how many" people affected
    And it has a checkbox that allows to choose whether to send a Custom SMS with this action
    And it is checked by default or not based on the action
    And - if checked by default or manually- it shows a free text field to enter the message
    And it shows a character counter
    And it has a "confirm" button, which is disabled if checkbox is checked AND the entered text is below 20 characters
    And it has a "cancel" button

  Scenario: Confirm apply action

    And the "changed data" is reflected in the table
    And the "action" dropdown is reset
    And the "apply action" is "disabled" again
    And all "row checkboxes" and "header checkbox" disappear
    And - if the action has an SMS-action and it is used - an SMS is sent to the PA

  Scenario: View and Filter PA-table with 2000 PAs
    Given there are 2000 PAs in the system
    When the user scrolls through the PA-table
    Then this goes quickly and without problem
    When the user uses the text or status filter functions
    Then the PA-table updates to only filtered rows quickly and without problem
