# How to contribute

Thanks for helping out!

## Submitting changes

Please submit changes through [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/). When you send a pull request, the description will be pre-populated with a sample description. Please adhere to it as much as possible.

Below is a list of other guidelines we try to follow for PRs.

- Draft PRs should be ignored by other developers (unless explicitly stated by the PR author).
- The PR author decides when a PR is ready for review.
  - Marking a PR as “ready for review” implies that it can (most likely will) be merged after an approval (unless explicitly stated otherwise by the PR author in the PR description).
  - When there has already been one review/reviewer on a PR, then that same reviewer will by default be expected to perform subsequent reviews on the same PR.
- PRs should have only one reviewer unless extra reviewer(s) are explicitly requested by a PR author or reviewer (i.e., When a reviewer or author does not feel confident about a set of changes).
- The PR author merges the PR into the target branch once the PR has been approved, but the reviewer can also decide to merge it immediately after an approval.
  - If the author wishes for the PR not to be merged after review, this must be explicitly stated in the PR description.
- PRs must be up to date with their target branch through the means of a rebase before being merged.
- Only the PR author can make changes to their PR/branch. If a reviewer wants changes to be made, they request changes via a review.
- For substantial changes, we prefer creating a "parent/feature" PR which receives multiple smaller PRs. For the parent PR and all the smaller child PRs, all the general guidelines apply.
