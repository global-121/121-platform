# Test Result Aggregation System

## Overview

This system automatically collects and aggregates test results from all test runners and shards across the 121 Platform CI workflows, providing a unified view of test failures in PR comments and workflow summaries.

## Components

### 1. GitHub Action: `aggregate-test-results`

Located in `.github/actions/aggregate-test-results/`, this TypeScript action:

- **Parses multiple test formats**: Jest JSON, Playwright results, and Karma summaries
- **Aggregates across shards**: Combines results from all sharded test runs
- **Generates reports**: Creates markdown summaries with failure details
- **Posts to PRs**: Updates or creates PR comments with test results
- **Workflow summaries**: Adds detailed results to GitHub Actions workflow summaries

### 2. Updated Workflows

All test workflows now output JSON results and upload them as artifacts:

- **`test_service_api.yml`**: Unit and integration tests (6 shards)
- **`test_e2e_portal.yml`**: E2E Playwright tests (6 shards)
- **`test_interface_portal.yml`**: Portal unit tests (Karma)
- **`test_mock-service_code.yml`**: Mock service tests

### 3. Configuration Updates

- **Jest**: Added `--json --outputFile` to generate structured test results
- **Playwright**: Added JSON reporter to `playwright.config.ts`
- **Workflows**: Added artifact uploads for test result files

## Features

### Comprehensive Test Parsing

- **Jest**: Parses assertion results with suite hierarchy and error details
- **Playwright**: Handles test retries, duration, and failure messages
- **Karma**: Aggregates browser test results (with limitations)

### Smart Failure Reporting

- **File grouping**: Groups failed tests by source file
- **Error truncation**: Limits error message length for readability
- **Shard tracking**: Shows which shard/job each failure occurred in
- **Retry information**: Displays retry counts for flaky tests

### Shard Overview

- **Status table**: Shows pass/fail status for each shard
- **Runner identification**: Displays which test runner was used
- **Quick debugging**: Easily identify which shards failed

## Usage

### Automatic Integration

The system runs automatically when:

1. **Test workflows complete**: Each workflow uploads test result artifacts
2. **Aggregation triggers**: The resolution jobs in workflows run the aggregator
3. **Results display**: Summaries appear in workflow logs and PR comments

### Manual Testing

To test the aggregator locally:

```bash
cd .github/actions/aggregate-test-results
npm test  # If tests were added
node test-failures.js  # Test with mock data
```

## Example Output

### Workflow Summary

```markdown
## üß™ Test Results Summary

‚ùå **Overall**: 3/5 tests passed (60%)

### üìä Results Breakdown

- ‚úÖ **Passed**: 3
- ‚ùå **Failed**: 2

### üîÄ Results by Shard/Job

| Shard  | Runner | Passed | Failed | Skipped | Status |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------- | ------ |
| unit-1 | jest   | 1      | 0      | 0       | ‚úÖ     |
| unit-2 | jest   | 0      | 1      | 0       | ‚ùå     |

### ‚ùå Failed Tests

#### üìÑ `src/auth/permissions.service.spec.ts`

- **should validate user permissions** (PermissionsService) [Shard: unit-2]
```

## Files Modified

### Workflows

- `.github/workflows/test_service_api.yml` - Added JSON output and aggregation
- `.github/workflows/test_e2e_portal.yml` - Added artifact uploads
- `.github/workflows/test_interface_portal.yml` - Added JSON reporter
- `.github/workflows/test_mock-service_code.yml` - Added JSON output
- `.github/workflows/aggregate_test_results.yml` - New workflow (optional)

### Configuration

- `e2e/playwright.config.ts` - Added JSON reporter
- Test workflows - Added `--json --outputFile` parameters

### New Files

- `.github/actions/aggregate-test-results/` - Complete TypeScript action
  - `action.yml` - Action definition
  - `src/index.ts` - Main entry point
  - `src/parser.ts` - Test result parsing logic
  - `src/report.ts` - Report generation
  - `src/types.ts` - TypeScript type definitions
  - `dist/` - Compiled JavaScript

## Security Considerations

- **Trusted code only**: The workflow_run aggregator uses main branch code to avoid executing untrusted code
- **Limited permissions**: Only requires read access to artifacts and write access to comments
- **Input validation**: All test result parsing includes error handling and validation

## Benefits

1. **Quick failure overview**: See all test failures at a glance in PR comments
2. **Shard debugging**: Easily identify which specific shard/job failed
3. **Context preservation**: Maintain error messages and stack traces
4. **Cross-runner support**: Works with Jest, Playwright, and Karma
5. **Scalable**: Handles any number of shards automatically

## Future Enhancements

- **Test trends**: Track test failure rates over time
- **Flaky test detection**: Identify tests that fail intermittently
- **Performance metrics**: Include test duration analysis
- **Custom notifications**: Send alerts for critical test failures
